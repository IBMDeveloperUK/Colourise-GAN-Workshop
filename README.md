# Intro to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

In this workshop you will learn what a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is and have a play with compling
an running your own one in IBM Watson Studio.

The GAN in this case is written using the PyTorch library and will be used to add colour to black and white images.

## Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.

In this workshop we will use IBM Watson Studio to run a notebook. For this you will need an IBM Cloud account. The following steps will show you how sign up and get started. When you have the notebook up and running we will go through the notebook.
